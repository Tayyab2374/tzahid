Project Description:
- Assignment Overview:
This project is an assignment that focuses on multiple key aspects of software development and 
professionalism. It includes modules related to Modularity, Version Control, Testing, Code 
Implementation, and Ethics & Professionalism.
The primary goal of the assignment is to demonstrate proficiency in designing modular code, 
utilizing version control for effective collaboration and tracking changes, conducting rigorous 
testing using black-box and white-box methodologies, implementing production code with high code 
quality, and adhering to ethical and professional software development practices.

- Modules:
The project is divided into several modules, each emphasizing a different aspect of software 
development:

1. Identifying Regular Polygons:
This module focuses on identifying regular polygons based on the number of sides.
It includes functions for recognizing polygon names and displaying images of polygons.
Testing involves black-box tests for equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis.

2. Calculating Perimeters and Areas:
In this module, the code is designed to calculate perimeters and areas of regular polygons.
It contains functions for calculating the perimeter and area for various polygon shapes.
White-box tests have been implemented to validate the code's internal logic.


This repository contains the code, documentation, and test cases for the assignment related to 
Modularity, Version Control, Testing, Code Implementation, and Ethics & Professionalism. 
The assignment is divided into multiple modules, each focusing on different aspects.

- Module Descriptions

1. Identifying_Regular_Polygons:
   - Code to identify regular polygons based on the number of sides.
   - Contains a `find_polygon_shape` function to identify polygon names and a `display_polygon_image` 
function to display images of polygons.
   - Testing includes black-box tests for equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis.

2. Calculating_Perimeters_and_Areas:
   - Code for calculating perimeters and areas of regular polygons.
   - Includes functions to calculate perimeter and area for various polygon shapes.
   - Testing consists of white-box tests for valid and invalid input cases.

3. README.txt:
   - This README file to provide an overview of the project, module descriptions, and test summaries.

- Test Summaries

The assignment includes both black-box and white-box testing methodologies.

Black-Box Testing:
   - Equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis were used for testing.
   - Test cases for regular polygon identification, temperature comparison, and perimeter/area 
calculations were created and executed.

White-Box Testing:
   - White-box tests were implemented for code validation.
   - These tests focus on the internal code logic, path coverage, and boundary conditions.

Version Control
Git was used to maintain version control for the project. Commits were made to track changes and 
collaborate on the assignment.

Challenges
Challenges included designing test cases for white-box testing and managing the testing of multiple 
modules within the assignment.

Limitations and Future Improvements
Future improvements may involve enhancing white-box testing coverage and implementing additional 
modules to cover other aspects of the assignment.
